# Plastic Case Scene
This repository houses my half of mine and Jack's final project, that being the case. The G-Code is made to be used with the Creality Ender3 printer.

## The process
Since this was my first time working with 3D objects, I had to build a few unrelated 3D objects first to familiarize myself with the tools. Once that was done, it was a matter of designing the actual case. I saw a picture of the circuit Jack assembled, asked him for the measurements and from there I got to work making a case that could house and make accessible all the components as necessary. Also asked Jack to make some adjustments so as to optimize the final product. Once the case was done I needed to learn about slicing so as to produce the G-Code necessary to actually print the case. Learning the theory of it was simple, but configuring the slicing software to the specifications of a certain printer was a tad challenging.
